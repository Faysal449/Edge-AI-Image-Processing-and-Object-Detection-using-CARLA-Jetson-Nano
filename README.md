# Edge-AI Image Processing and Object Detection using CARLA & Jetson Nano



## Overview

This project implements a Distributed Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation framework where a CARLA simulator running on a PC streams camera frames to an NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge device for real-time AI inference. Two object detection models — **SSD-MobileNet-V2** and **YOLOv8** — are deployed and benchmarked on the Jetson Nano to evaluate inference performance under realistic edge conditions.

The objective is to replicate a real autonomous vehicle architecture, where sensor data is processed on an embedded edge system under realistic network conditions.

## Communication Pipeline

### Frame Transmission (PC Side)

- CARLA generates RGB camera frames
- Frames are converted to NumPy arrays
- JPEG compression is applied
- Data is transmitted via TCP/UDP socket

**Packet Structure:**

```
| Frame ID | Timestamp | Image Size | JPEG Image Data |
```

### Frame Processing (Jetson Nano)

- Receive frame via TCP/UDP
- Decode JPEG image
- Convert to CUDA memory
- Run TensorRT inference (SSD-MobileNet-V2 or YOLOv8)
- Output detection results

## Key Insights

- TCP achieves slightly lower steady-state latency (~52 ms) with a graceful buffer drain during warm-up
- UDP shows a faster but abrupt convergence, resolving its initial backlog (~4,300 ms peak) through frame dropping rather than queuing — resulting in a 266-frame gap at start-up
- Jetson inference time (~37–45 ms) is the dominant latency contributor regardless of protocol
- YOLOv8 delivers higher detection accuracy at the cost of increased inference time compared to SSD-MobileNet-V2
- TensorRT FP16 optimization is essential for achieving real-time performance on Jetson Nano for both models
